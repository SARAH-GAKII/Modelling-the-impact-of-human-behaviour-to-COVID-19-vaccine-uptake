# Modeling the Impact of Human Behavior on COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake

This project was completed as part of my Master's thesis at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) South Africa. It investigates how individual and collective behavior influences vaccine uptake during the COVID-19 pandemic through mathematical modeling and numerical simulations.
