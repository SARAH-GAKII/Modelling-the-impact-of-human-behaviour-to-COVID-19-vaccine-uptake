# Modeling the Impact of Human Behavior on COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake

This project was completed as part of my Master’s thesis at the **African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) South Africa**. It explores how individual and collective behavior influences vaccine uptake during the COVID-19 pandemic using mathematical modeling and Python-based simulations.
